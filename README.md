👋 Hi, I’m Marine!
I’m a freelance fullstack developer passionate about bringing ideas to life on the web.

💻 My current stack:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Python, and headless CMSs like Strapi.

🌟 What I do:
I specialize in (re)creating dynamic websites using React/Next.js and headless CMSs.
On the side, I’m working on Unsung Women (🚧 under construction): a collaborative platform celebrating the incredible women who’ve shaped history, built with a Python backend and React frontend.

🎨 When I’m not coding:
You’ll probably find me doing yoga 🧘🏼‍♀️, painting with watercolors 🎨, or making pottery 🏺.

📬 Let’s connect:
Feel free to reach out at marine.m.crouzet@gmail.com – whether to chat about coding, business, or a cool project you’d like to collaborate on.
