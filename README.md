- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarineCrou
- 👀 I’m interested in many things : Yoga 🧘🏼‍♀️, WaterColor 🎨, Pottery 🏺, Slow-travel 🚂, business 📈 and coding 👩‍💻. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code (HTML, CSS, JS, react & Python). Goal, become a web developer (front, back or full is still to be determined).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I'm so excited to learn. Hopefully I will be able to finetune my response to this question, as I dive deeper into coding.
- 📫 How to reach me : email is the best way : marine.m.crouzet@gmail.com
